   <h2>Hi, I'm Rachel!</h2>
   <img src="photo.jpg" width="250" class="image-circle" alt="intro photo">
   <p>I currently reside in Reading, PA. As a Software Engineering student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> some things
     I've loved about my journey so far are:</p>
   <ul class="lists">
     <li>Being able to find my coding errors and correct them</li>
     <li>Confidently reading code</li>
     <li>Learning just how much goes into creating a website from scratch</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Please take a look at the rest of my site to learn a little more about me!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>After working in Property Management for 10 years I decided to make a career change after learning a little bit about coding.
         I never would have imagined the complexities of web development and as challenging as it can be, it has been even more rewarding! 
         I can't wait to see where Thinkful takes me on my next career path. Please feel free to reach out to me as I am very interested in getting to know 
         and work with other developers!</p>
    <p>When I am not practicing code I will typically be reading a Stephen King novel, working out, or relaxing with my pets!</p>
